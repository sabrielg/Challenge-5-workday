# Challenge-5-workday

## Description
This project was created so that a user can plan their workday beginning at 10am and ending at 6pm. When a user enters a task it is saved in local storage so that when they reload the page the task will also be loaded. The hours are color coded to indicate the past, present, and future. 

This project utilizes moment, local Storage, JavaScript, Jquery, and Bootstrap. I learned how to style using bootstrap and jquery along with using moment to define time.
## Installation

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
